# TRANSKRIBUS

## TRANSCRIPTION CONVENTION:
-- hyphens to signalize newline are transcribed as simple hyphens '-'
-- hyphens to signalize multiword-expressions are transcribed as -/
-- double hyphen signalizes dash
-- # is used to mark phonological units (in the original hypens are used)
-- Metadata (speaker, interviewe, year, etc.) are in []
-- y̆ is transcribed as у&
-- ӑ is transcribed as ə
-- long vowels and consonants are marked with a postposed ~
-- short/ reduced vowels and consonants are marked with a postposed ^

## TO-DO
-- replace ə with å, where appropriate p.1-22 (I thought I could use ə instead of å but no...)

## REMARKS
-- one hyphen at the end of a line -> true makeup
-- hyphen at the end of a line and on the next line -> prosodic boundary
-- BUT a lot of errors...

## QUESTIONS
-- order of stress and other markings, e.g. по~_ќе or по_~ќе? (so far по~_ќе)
-- How to mark when two vowels are connected with an arc above?
-- What's about л´? Is it stress? -> e.g. p.90: 19, 23, 24, p.91: 17, 38, 
p.92: 8, 30, p.93: 44, 45, p.94, 3, 24, 33, p.95: 6, 10, 12, 14, 19,
